VR Safe Riding Project


# VR Riding
VR-riding is a virtual reality (VR) software application that allows cyclists and personal mobility device (PMD) users to practice safe riding on Singapore roads, walkways and shared paths. VR-riding also allows the users to have a free range of motion within the area and give them the feelings of immersion within the virtual environment, thus providing a pleasant and intuitive experience. Ultimately, the aim of VR-riding is to educate users on the safety aspect of commuting by cycling or with their PMD’s in Singapore. 

This document will state the functional and non-functional requirements of VR-riding, as well as the expected interactions between VR-riding and the users of VR-riding.
